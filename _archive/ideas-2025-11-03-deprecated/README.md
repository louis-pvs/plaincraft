# Ideas Folder - DEPRECATED

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED (2025-11-03):** The `/ideas` folder and idea intake workflow have been removed from this repository.

## What Happened

The ideas-based workflow, including:
- Idea file creation and management
- `ideas/` folder structure  
- Idea-to-issue automation (`scripts/ops/ideas-to-issues.mjs`)
- Idea intake scripts (`scripts/ops/idea-intake.mjs`)
- GitHub Projects integration for idea lifecycle

...has been **deprecated and archived** as of November 3, 2025.

## Archived Location

All previous idea files have been moved to:
```
/_archive/ideas-2025-11-03-deprecated/
```

## Replacement Workflow

Lane D no longer manages:
- ❌ Lifecycle governance via GitHub Projects
- ❌ Backlog management and project stewardship  
- ❌ Idea intake and status tracking
- ❌ Project schema maintenance

Refer to updated Lane D documentation for current responsibilities.

## Related Deprecated Scripts

The following scripts are no longer functional:
- `scripts/ops/idea-intake.mjs`
- `scripts/ops/ideas-to-issues.mjs`  
- `scripts/ops/sync-ideas-checklists.mjs`
- `scripts/checks/validate-ideas.mjs`
- All DEPRECATED scripts in `scripts/DEPRECATED/` that reference ideas

## Migration Path

If you need to reference old ideas:
1. Check `/_archive/ideas-2025-11-03-deprecated/` for the archived content
2. Consider alternative workflows that don't depend on the ideas folder structure
