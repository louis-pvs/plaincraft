# C-search-refine

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane A (Foundations & Tooling) for unit delivery, Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for performance guardrails.
- **Labels:** composition, search, analytics

## Metric Hypothesis

Increase filter-driven conversion by 10% with a reference search + refine experience that stabilizes debounce behavior and empty states.

## Units In Scope

- `U-debounced-search` — manage query input and chip filters.
- `U-responsive-table` — present results in responsive table/card views.
- `U-skeleton-switch` — handle loading states.

## Purpose

Provide a polished search refinement journey demonstrating filter chips, responsive results, and clear empty state messaging.

## Problem

Search pages today either overwhelm with updates or hide empty states. Debounce logic duplicates across teams, leading to inconsistent metrics and sluggish UX.

## Proposal

1. Wire search input to responsive table with skeleton loader transitions.
2. Document empty/no-results experiences and their announcements.
3. Capture Storybook demos for default, filtered, and empty states, plus GIF for Playbook.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Debounce fires only once per term change under test.
- [ ] Empty state remains visible and descriptive in responsive layouts.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft drafted for search refine composition governance.
