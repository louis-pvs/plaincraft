# PB-unit-definition

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane A (Foundations & Tooling) for unit criteria, Lane D (Program Operations) for onboarding guidance.
- **Labels:** documentation, unit, playbook

## Purpose

Define what constitutes a governed Unit, including required props/behavior/a11y sections and acceptance checklist template for contributors.

## Problem

Contributors struggle to determine when work qualifies as a Unit versus composition, leading to inconsistent documentation, missing acceptance lists, and onboarding drag for new templates.

## Proposal

1. Capture canonical Unit definition with decision tree and naming rules.
2. Provide copy-paste template block covering props, behaviors, a11y, status log, and acceptance checklist.
3. Link supporting automation (lint, drift checks) and how to request reviews from lane owners.

## Process

1. Draft the decision tree and template block in collaboration with Lane A template owners.
2. Embed the block in the Playbook page and link to `/templates/ideas/idea-unit-template.md`.
3. Validate the page via guardrails (lint + view dedupe) and secure Lane A/C sign-off.
4. Announce availability in the backlog status update with adoption steps for squads.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Copyable Unit template block included.
- [ ] Props/behavior/a11y expectations spelled out with examples.
- [ ] Acceptance checklist requirements listed for quick adoption.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft opened for Unit definition playbook page.
