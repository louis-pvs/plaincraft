# PB-metrics-mapping

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane D (Program Operations) for business reporting, Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for instrumentation hooks.
- **Labels:** documentation, metrics, playbook

## Purpose

Map common Unit/Composition patterns to business metrics (drop-off, TTFX, support load) so squads connect design decisions to measurable impact.

## Problem

Teams struggle to articulate which metrics a pattern influences, leading to weak success criteria and poor prioritization discussions.

## Proposal

1. Catalog patterns with associated metrics, instrumentation hints, and example dashboards.
2. Provide case studies showing before/after metric impact.
3. Offer templates for noting metric hypotheses in ideas/issues.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Examples included for drop-off, TTFX, and support load.
- [ ] Instrumentation notes linked to analytics tooling.
- [ ] Template snippet provided for idea metric hypotheses.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft created to align metrics mapping guidance.
