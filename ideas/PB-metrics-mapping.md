# PB-metrics-mapping

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane D (Program Operations) for business reporting, Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for instrumentation hooks.
- **Labels:** documentation, metrics, playbook

## Purpose

Map common Unit/Composition patterns to business metrics (drop-off, TTFX, support load) so squads connect design decisions to measurable impact.

## Problem

Teams struggle to articulate which metrics a pattern influences, leading to weak success criteria and poor prioritization discussions.

## Proposal

1. Catalog patterns with associated metrics, instrumentation hints, and example dashboards.
2. Provide case studies showing before/after metric impact.
3. Offer templates for noting metric hypotheses in ideas/issues.

## Process

1. Gather data points from Lane D reporting and Lane C telemetry dashboards.
2. Draft mapping tables linking patterns â†’ metrics and embed instrumentation guidance.
3. Review with analytics stakeholders, update based on feedback, and run docs guardrails.
4. Publish and circulate snippet for inclusion in future idea metric sections.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Examples included for drop-off, TTFX, and support load.
- [ ] Instrumentation notes linked to analytics tooling.
- [ ] Template snippet provided for idea metric hypotheses.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft created to align metrics mapping guidance.
