# ARCH-e2e-test

Lane: C (DevOps & Automation)

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** C (DevOps & Automation)
- **Partners:** Lane D for workflow policy validation

## Purpose

Validate the complete end-to-end workflow from idea creation through deployment, testing all DevOps scripts and automation to ensure the lifecycle pipeline works correctly.

## Problem

We have implemented numerous DevOps scripts and workflow automation, but we haven't validated that they work together as an integrated system. Without end-to-end validation:

- We don't know if idea intake → branch creation → PR workflow → changelog extraction → deployment works seamlessly
- Scripts may have integration issues that only surface when used in sequence
- New contributors can't easily verify the workflow is working correctly
- We risk deploying broken workflow automation to the project

## Proposal

1. Create a minimal test idea file following the proper format
2. Run `ideas:create` script to convert idea to GitHub issue and add to project
3. Use `ops:create-branch` to create a feature branch
4. Make a small test change (add simple test file)
5. Use `ops:open-or-update-pr` to open a PR with changelog section
6. Merge PR and verify `pr-changelog` workflow extracts changelog
7. Use `ops:closeout` to archive the idea
8. Trigger version bump and verify changelog consolidation
9. Verify deployment and all artifacts are accessible
