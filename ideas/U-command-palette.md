# U-command-palette

Lane: A (Foundations & Tooling)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** A (Foundations & Tooling)
- **Partners:** Lane B (Narrative & Enablement) for demos, Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for shortcut guardrails.
- **Labels:** unit, command-palette, accessibility

## Purpose

Deliver a reusable command palette with deterministic keyboard navigation and execution semantics fit for cross-product shortcuts.

## Problem

Command palette patterns currently vary in focus handling, dismissal logic, and execution feedback. This results in confusing shortcuts and poor accessibility, blocking consistent storytelling.

## Proposal

1. Define props for trigger shortcuts, command list data, filtering, and callbacks.
2. Implement open/close toggles, arrow key navigation, enter activation, and escape dismissal with proper announcements.
3. Provide Storybook interactions, automated tests, and a recordable flow for Playbook reference.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Palette opens/closes reliably via shortcuts and UI control.
- [ ] Up/Down arrow keys cycle commands with focus retention.
- [ ] Enter runs the selected command with feedback; Escape exits.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft logged to align command palette behavior.
