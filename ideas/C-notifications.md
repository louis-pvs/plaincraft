# C-notifications

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane A (Foundations & Tooling) for unit delivery, Lane D (Program Operations) for rollout messaging.
- **Labels:** composition, notifications, accessibility

## Metric Hypothesis

Boost notification preference adoption by 20% through a guided toggle flow paired with quick command palette actions and confirmation messaging.

## Units In Scope

- `U-command-palette` — expose quick actions.
- `U-snackbar-undo` — confirm changes with undo path.
- `U-skeleton-switch` — manage loading vs ready states.

## Purpose

Ship a reference notification management experience that works equally well for keyboard/pointer users and anchors documentation.

## Problem

Notification settings lack consistent loading states, accessible toggles, and quick access to actions. Support escalations highlight confusion and inconsistent copy.

## Proposal

1. Combine skeleton switch to show loading vs live settings.
2. Provide command palette quick actions that sync state with toggles.
3. Confirm updates via snackbar undo and publish Storybook demos + GIF.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Notification toggles announce state changes to screen readers.
- [ ] Command palette actions execute successfully in Storybook demos.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft created to align notifications composition.
