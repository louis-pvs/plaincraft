# PB-a11y-policy

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane A (Foundations & Tooling) for component standards, Lane D (Program Operations) for compliance tracking.
- **Labels:** documentation, accessibility, playbook

## Purpose

Document the baseline accessibility policy covering keyboard paths, roles, screen reader hints, and axe rules that every Unit and Composition must enforce.

## Problem

Accessibility expectations live in scattered docs and PR comments, making it difficult for teams to know the minimum contract. Audits find repeated gaps in keyboard support and ARIA usage.

## Proposal

1. Capture mandatory keyboard patterns, role usage, and announcement rules by component category.
2. List axe rules and manual checks required before sign-off, with links to guardrail tooling.
3. Provide examples (do/donâ€™t) and references to Storybook docs for deeper dives.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Keyboard path requirements documented per component type.
- [ ] Roles and SR hint guidelines listed with examples.
- [ ] Axe rule checklist published with links to automation.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft opened for accessibility policy playbook.
