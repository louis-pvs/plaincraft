# U-debounced-search

Lane: A (Foundations & Tooling)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** A (Foundations & Tooling)
- **Partners:** Lane B (Narrative & Enablement) for docs + recordings, Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for testing harness integration.
- **Labels:** unit, search, accessibility

## Purpose

Provide a search input unit with built-in debouncing, chip filters, and a canonical recording so compositions can rely on deterministic behavior.

## Problem

Search flows repeatedly reimplement debouncing and chip management, leading to race conditions, redundant network calls, and inconsistent keyboard support. Without a unit, downstream compositions stay brittle.

## Proposal

1. Specify props for value, debounce duration, chips, and callbacks for query + chip changes.
2. Implement debounced submission with cancellable timers, accessible chip add/remove, and clear-button semantics.
3. Cover behavior with unit tests, `play()` driven Storybook demos, and a recordable story for narrative assets.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Debounce behavior verified with automated test coverage.
- [ ] Chip add/remove flows work with keyboard + pointer.
- [ ] Clear button resets query and announces state change.
- [ ] Record story captured for documentation.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft opened to track debounced search unit scope.
