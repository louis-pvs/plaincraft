Lane: D (handoff to B for docs rollout)

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** D (Experience & Narrative)
- **Handoffs:** Lane B for docs rollout and analytics verification.

## Metric Hypothesis

Move first-session publish completion from 28% → 43% by sequencing the initial Units with an explicit contract checklist.

## Units In Scope

- `U-bridge-intro-card` — gatekeeps the onboarding checklist and launches the flow.
- `U-project-telemetry-hook` — attaches analytics to guide step completion.
- `U-docs-inline-handoff` — surfaces contextual docs inside the composition.

## Invariants

- Ensure analytics fire in order and that Unit contracts stay discoverable from the docs.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Units in scope are linked in the Plaincraft Roadmap with lane labels.
- [ ] Metric dashboard alert configured for onboarding completion delta.
- [ ] Rollout playbook details contracts, fallback, and post-launch invariants.
