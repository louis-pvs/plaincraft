# PB-versioning-contracts

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for tooling hooks, Lane D (Program Operations) for communication cadence.
- **Labels:** documentation, governance, versioning

## Purpose

Document how Units and Compositions version their contracts, define “stable,” and communicate breaking changes—even before external publishing begins.

## Problem

Without a shared versioning contract, teams guess how to mark breaking changes, causing rollbacks and inconsistent communication to stakeholders.

## Proposal

1. Define stability levels for Units/Compositions and how they graduate.
2. Capture change classification (patch/minor/major) with required mitigation steps.
3. Outline migration doc expectations and notification cadence across lanes.

## Process

1. Align with Lane C automation on stability signals and version metadata storage.
2. Draft the Playbook guidance with classification tables and migration templates.
3. Validate with recent changes (retrofit one example) and gather lane sign-offs.
4. Publish and include comms plan template for Lane D to use in status updates.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Semantic hints documented for Units/Compositions.
- [ ] Breaking-change workflow described with owner responsibilities.
- [ ] Migration playbook template linked for follow-up work.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft logged for versioning contracts guidance.
