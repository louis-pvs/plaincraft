# Idea: Creator Onboarding Bridge

Lane: D (Experience & Narrative)

## Problem

First-time creators bounce before configuring their first scene because they do not know which Units to assemble.

## Signal

Only 28% of new projects reach the "Publish" button in their first session.

## Hunch

A composition that scaffolds the first three Units will improve completion by 15%.

## Notes

- Needs inline guidance and contracts that remind creators about analytics hooks.
- Lane D can draft the experience, with handoff to lane B for docs once validated.

## Tickets

- Composition: `C-creator-onboarding-bridge`
- Primary Unit: `U-bridge-intro-card`
