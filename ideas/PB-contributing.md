Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for guardrail references, Lane D (Program Operations) for reviewer ownership table.
- **Labels:** documentation, contributing, governance

## Purpose

Publish the contributing guide for Plaincraft patterns, covering file globs per lane, commit/PR conventions, and review responsibilities.

## Problem

New contributors struggle to find authoritative guidance on where files live, how to reference ideas in commits, and who approves changes. This slows reviews and causes policy misses.

## Proposal

1. Map repository globs to lane ownership with quick reference tables.
2. Document commit/PR conventions, including guardrails (`pnpm guardrails`, `commit:guard`) and required checklists.
3. Provide reviewer matrix detailing who owns what plus escalation paths.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] “Who owns what” table included with lane + reviewer mapping.
- [ ] Commit/PR convention section links to templates and guardrails.
- [ ] File glob guidance listed for each lane.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft logged for contributing playbook update.
