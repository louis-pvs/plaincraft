# C-address-select

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane A (Foundations & Tooling) for unit readiness, Lane D (Program Operations) for adoption checklist alignment.
- **Labels:** composition, search, a11y

## Metric Hypothesis

Reduce support pings about address entry failures by 30% by guiding users through a resilient search → manual fallback experience.

## Units In Scope

- `U-debounced-search` — capture address query with keyboard-friendly chips.
- `U-skeleton-switch` — surface loading vs results states.
- `U-field-error` — show inline validation for manual entry fallback.

## Purpose

Compose a complete address search flow that handles loading, empty, retry, and manual entry while staying accessible and story-ready.

## Problem

Current address flows split across bespoke implementations. Users face dead ends when search misses, fallback metadata is inconsistent, and documentation lacks a canonical walkthrough for training.

## Proposal

1. Orchestrate debounced search results with skeletons and inline errors feeding manual entry.
2. Provide cohesive Storybook stories (happy path, empty, fallback) with `play()` coverage and GIF capture.
3. Document metrics + fallback behavior in Playbook and ensure guardrails cover cross-unit integration.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Happy path demonstrates search → select → confirmation with deterministic data.
- [ ] Manual entry fallback documented and accessible when search fails.
- [ ] GIF and Storybook story link published for Playbook reference.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft created to track address select composition rollout.
