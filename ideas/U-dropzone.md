## Lane

Lane: A (Foundations & Tooling)

- **Primary Lane:** A (Foundations & Tooling)
- **Partners:** Lane B (Narrative & Enablement), Lane C (DevOps & Automation)
- **Labels:** unit, upload, accessibility

## Contracts

- Unify file validation and preview generation across drag/drop and input selection.
- Ensure rejection messaging and instrumentation integrate with downstream reporting.

## Props + Shape

- `accept: string[]` â€” allowed MIME types/extensions.
- `maxSizeMb: number`
- `multiple?: boolean`
- `files: Array<{ id: string; name: string; size: number; previewUrl?: string }>`
- `onDrop(files: FileList): void`
- `onRemove(id: string): void`
- `onRetry?(id: string): void`

## Behaviors

- Dragging highlights dropzone and announces instructions to screen readers.
- Drop/choose flows share the same validation pipeline for size/type rules.
- Generates preview slots and exposes hooks for retry/remove actions.

## Status
