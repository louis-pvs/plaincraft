# C-billing-method

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane A (Foundations & Tooling) for unit readiness, Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for integration tests with payment mocks.
- **Labels:** composition, billing, accessibility

## Metric Hypothesis

Improve successful payment method saves by 15% through a guided validation → confirmation flow with explicit copy-token guidance.

## Units In Scope

- `U-field-error` — surface async validation feedback for card data.
- `U-copy-hint` — allow copying generated token with countdown hint.
- `U-snackbar-undo` — provide undo/confirmation messaging post-save.

## Purpose

Deliver a reference billing setup experience that handles validation errors, token capture, and confirmation messaging with strong accessibility.

## Problem

Billing forms currently lack consistent validation messaging, making tokens hard to retrieve and auditors uncertain about flows. Support cases highlight confusion after saving.

## Proposal

1. Combine async validation for card inputs with inline feedback and retry loops.
2. Generate sample token and expose copy hint with fallback in Storybook.
3. Document confirmation and undo flows via Storybook demos plus Playbook copy.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Token copy path verified in Storybook and documentation.
- [ ] Validation errors read correctly by screen readers.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft logged for billing method composition rollout.
