# PB-glossary

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane D (Program Operations) for training materials, Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for ID scheme validation.
- **Labels:** documentation, glossary, playbook

## Purpose

Publish a glossary that defines Unit, Composition, Recording, Playbook, ID scheme, and other Plaincraft vocabulary to keep cross-lane communication aligned.

## Problem

Teams interpret key terms differently, causing confusion in status updates, roadmap discussions, and guardrail reports. Without a glossary, onboarding drags and automation references drift.

## Proposal

1. Collect authoritative definitions for core concepts with links to source templates and policies.
2. Document ID scheme patterns (U-/C-/ARCH-/PB-) and where they apply.
3. Include pronunciation/usage notes and embed searchable anchors in the Playbook.

## Process

1. Aggregate existing definitions from templates, Storybook docs, and ADRs.
2. Draft glossary entries with links back to source material and ID scheme guidance.
3. Run docs guardrails, ensure anchors render in the Playbook sidebar, and add search metadata.
4. Share the glossary with Lane D training leads for onboarding use.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Glossary entries cover Unit, Composition, Recording, Playbook, and ID scheme.
- [ ] Each entry links to authoritative template or policy doc.
- [ ] Page indexed for Playbook sidebar with search anchors.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft created for glossary playbook page.
