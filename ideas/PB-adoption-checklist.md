# PB-adoption-checklist

Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane D (Program Operations) for rollout sequencing, Lane C (DevOps & Automation) for guardrail checks.
- **Labels:** documentation, rollout, playbook

## Purpose

Publish a standard checklist for squads adopting a Unit or Composition so rollouts stay safe, measurable, and reversible.

## Problem

Without a shared adoption checklist, teams skip telemetry, forget fallback planning, and fail to align owners/dates. This increases risk and slows approvals across lanes.

## Proposal

1. Enumerate rollout steps covering dry-run validation, guardrail confirmation, and status-note templates.
2. Capture kill criteria guidance and owner/date capture requirements.
3. Provide copy-ready checklist for issues/PRs plus Playbook status integration.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Rollout steps listed with references to required scripts/tests.
- [ ] Kill criteria section documented with escalation path.
- [ ] Owner/date capture guidance provided for status updates.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft logged to standardize adoption checklist playbook.
