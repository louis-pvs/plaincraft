Lane: B (Narrative & Enablement)
Status: Draft

## Lane

- **Primary Lane:** B (Narrative & Enablement)
- **Partners:** Lane A (Foundations & Tooling) for unit dependencies, Lane D (Program Operations) for rollout governance.
- **Labels:** documentation, composition, playbook

## Purpose

Clarify what qualifies as a Composition, detailing metric hooks, fallback expectations, and documentation requirements.

## Problem

Teams conflate compositions with ad-hoc flows, omitting metric hypotheses and fallback coverage. This leads to gaps in analytics storytelling and inconsistent handoffs between lanes.

## Proposal

1. Describe composition criteria, including required units and dependency mapping.
2. Provide a checklist for metric hypothesis, fallback states, and Storybook/Playbook assets.
3. Offer guidance on linking compositions to roadmap cards and status reports.

## Process

1. Partner with Lane A to catalogue required units and dependency relationships.
2. Draft the checklist + template block, then validate against existing compositions (`C-profile-form-composed`, etc.).
3. Publish the Playbook entry, add links to Storybook examples, and run guardrail lint.
4. Notify Lane D backlog pilots to adopt the definition during intake reviews.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] “Metric hypothesis” checklist captured with example questions.
- [ ] Composition template block provided with required sections.
- [ ] Guidance on linking units + metrics to roadmap documented.

## Status

- 2025-11-07 - Draft captured for composition definition page.
