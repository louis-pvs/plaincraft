# Lifecycle PR Refresh (view)

Refreshing the PR body keeps reviewers synced with the latest acceptance state and makes sure automation can reconcile checklists. Use the `pnpm pr:generate` helper alongside the verification guardrail so the Playbook, Issue, and PR always agree.

## System of Record

- **Content:** `/ideas/<ID>-*.md` (acceptance checklist + context copied into PR)
- **Status:** GitHub Projects – promotion from `Branched` → `PR Open`
- **Automation:** `pnpm pr:generate` → `scripts/ops/generate-pr-content.mjs`

## Command Contract

```bash
# Refresh PR body for the active branch
pnpm pr:generate --yes
pnpm pr:verify    # optional: confirm checklist sync
```

- Default dry-run prints the proposed PR body diff.
- Pass `--head <branch>` or `--issue <number>` to target a specific lifecycle item.
- Pair with `pnpm pr:verify` (runs `scripts/checks/pr-requirements.mjs --verify-pr`) before requesting review.

## Worked Example

After landing design feedback, run `pnpm pr:generate --yes` to rehydrate the PR body from the idea file. The command keeps the acceptance checklist ordered and mirrors the summary so the narrative matches Playbook status notes. `pnpm pr:verify` confirms the merged checklist state and flags any missing reviewer tasks before you re-request review, preventing status drift in Projects.

## Constraints

- Acceptance checklist items must be GitHub checkboxes; the generator toggles them to match Issue progress.
- Keep idea metadata (`Lane`, `Owner`, `Priority`) current—PR refresh picks them up for the header.
- Do not edit the generated PR body by hand; rerun the generator so automation sees the change and dry-run history stays auditable.
