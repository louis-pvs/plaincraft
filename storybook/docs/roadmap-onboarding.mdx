# Roadmap Onboarding (view)

The Plaincraft Roadmap keeps lanes visible across Issues, PRs, and templates. A consistent setup means automation can push cards, enforce WIP limits, and surface metrics without manual cleanup.

## Signals to Watch

- Missing lane labels or mismatched project IDs break CI status mirrors.
- Views without WIP caps invite scope creep for each lane.
- Scripts failing to find the roadmap indicate authentication or project drift.

## Worked Example

During the README migration, Lane D cloned the roadmap template, ran `gh:setup-project`, and used the generated output to confirm automation IDs. The project surfaced PB-readme narratives under Lane B while Lane C tracked guardrail scripts under Lane C views.

## Hand-off Links

- Template README → `/templates/roadmap-project/README.md`
- Template USAGE → `/templates/roadmap-project/USAGE.md`
- Automation scripts → `scripts/ops/setup-project.mjs`, `scripts/ops/setup-labels.mjs`

## Constraints

- Keep the project name and custom fields aligned with `pipeline-config.json`.
- Lane views must filter by `lane:<letter>` and honor the WIP limit of 3.
- Refresh GitHub CLI tokens with `project` scope before running setup scripts.
