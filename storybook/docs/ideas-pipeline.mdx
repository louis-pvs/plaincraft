# Ideas Pipeline (view)

Plaincraft treats `/ideas` as the single source of truth for delivery work. Cards seed Issues, PRs, and release notes, so a healthy pipeline keeps automation honest and reviewers in context.

## Signals to Watch

- Missing `Lane:` metadata or acceptance checklists hints at automation drift.
- Parent ideas without `## Sub-Issues` make sub-issue progress invisible downstream.
- Cards lingering in `/ideas/` after merge clog the roadmap audit trail.

## Worked Example

When `PB-readme-narrative-migration` moved into delivery, the idea card anchored the acceptance list. Running `ideas-to-issues` synced checklists to GitHub, `pnpm gh:worktree` updated the same card to include the new issue number and `status: in-progress`, and `merge-subissue-to-parent` refreshed the parent PR each time a child branch merged. The card stayed authoritative until archival.

## Hand-off Links

- Template README → `/templates/ideas/README.md`
- Template USAGE → `/templates/ideas/USAGE.md`
- Ops scripts → `scripts/ops/ideas-to-issues.mjs`, `scripts/ops/create-worktree-pr.mjs`, `scripts/ops/merge-subissue-to-parent.mjs`

## Constraints

- Card exists before Issue; automation refuses to run otherwise.
- Bootstrapping a branch with `pnpm gh:worktree` must leave the real idea file at `status: in-progress` with the assigned `Issue: #` so downstream automation can trust it.
- Ticket prefixes drive PR titles, changelog slugs, and roadmap cards—keep them aligned.
- Archive closed ideas promptly to keep the `/ideas` directory actionable.
