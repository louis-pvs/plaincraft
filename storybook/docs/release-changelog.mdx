# Release Changelog (view)

Release storytelling runs through `_tmp/` summaries promoted by `consolidate-changelog.mjs`. The goal is to keep highlights business-ready while automation enforces formatting.

## Signals to Watch

- `_tmp/` backlog growing past three files suggests release drift.
- Missing ticket slugs in summaries breaks changelog traceability.
- Skipped `--dry-run` previews leave stakeholders blind to wording changes.

## Worked Example

`PB-readme-narrative-migration` shipped its release copy by drafting `_tmp/102-readme-migration.md`, running `pnpm changelog -- --dry-run`, and sharing the diff before promoting with `--yes`. The Playbook pattern captures the stakeholder story; the README links bring engineers back to executable docs.

## Hand-off Links

- Template README → `/templates/changelog/README.md`
- Template USAGE → `/templates/changelog/USAGE.md`
- Ops script → `scripts/ops/consolidate-changelog.mjs`
- Playbook narrative → `/playbook/patterns/release-changelog-automation.html`

## Constraints

- Every summary must reference a ticket ID; the script fails fast otherwise.
- Keep `_tmp/` under version control so CI catches stale entries.
- Publish the Playbook highlight within 24 hours of promoting the changelog entry.
