# Contracts Manifest

> Canonical source for public workflow and governance contracts referenced in `ARCH-one-artifact-e2e-orch.md`.

## Purpose

Provide a single auditable list of active contracts (identity, lifecycle, schema, frontmatter, template, governance) with owners, versioning, and review cadence so automation and guardrails can reconcile drift.

## Contract List

## Guardrails

- Each contract must list: ID, owner, source doc, review interval, status.
- Contracts without an owner or overdue review become `Stale` and should block merges touching related areas after grace period.
- Automation may generate a coverage report linking contracts to tests and docs.

## Next Steps

1. Implement coverage linking (contracts → ADRs → tests/templates).
2. Add stale detection script updating this file.
3. Integrate with `guardrails` scope for enforcement.
