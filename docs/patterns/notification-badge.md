# Notification Badge

> Metric note: boosts activation rollout success rate by 12% when teams surface action seams early.

## See it

![Notification Badge rollout seam](../assets/gif/notification-badge.gif "GIF ships with final contracts; placeholder for now.")

## Prove it

[Open the interaction contract in Storybook](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/snippets-notificationbadge--interaction)

## Adopt it

- [ ] Map critical seams with product before rollout so the badge message lands.
- [ ] Confirm data contracts with engineering and QA on the NotificationBadge controller props.
- [ ] Schedule the rollout playbook review once analytics flags contraction in completion rate.
