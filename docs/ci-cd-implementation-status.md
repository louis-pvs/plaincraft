## Executive Summary

**Original Goal:** Keep pipelines fast, split lanes cleanly, automate status flow from Idea to PR to Done.

**Current Reality:** Script-based automation with ideas-as-source-of-truth pattern replacing workflow orchestration. CI split complete with 6 jobs running in parallel. Deploy automation implemented. Recording re-enabled with optimization.

**Key Evolution:** Manual script-based workflow provides more control and flexibility than planned workflow automation. Ideas-as-files pattern eliminates Issue/PR duplication.

**Completion:** 85% (all critical paths complete, optimization opportunities remain)

## What Got Built

### CI/CD Infrastructure (✅ Exceeded Plan)

**Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**

6 parallel jobs:

1. **`check`** - Typecheck, lint, format check, unit tests
2. **`build-storybook`** - Static Storybook build
3. **`storybook-test`** - Headless interaction & a11y tests (depends on build-storybook)
4. **`build-demo`** - Vite demo build
5. **`build-playbook`** - VitePress playbook build
6. **`summary`** - Aggregate results (depends on all above)

**Additional job (conditional):**

7. **`record-nightly`** - Story video recording (only on schedule/manual dispatch)

**Features:**

- ✅ pnpm dependency caching on all jobs
- ✅ Playwright browser caching (versioned, with restore/save pattern)
- ✅ JUnit artifact uploads for test results
- ✅ Concurrency controls (`cancel-in-progress: true`)
- ✅ Recording: 960px width, 10-second cap, nightly schedule
- ✅ Artifact retention: 30 days (tests), 7 days (builds)
- ✅ **Timeout controls** (implemented 2025-10-28)

**Workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**

- Triggers on CI completion (workflow_run) + manual dispatch
- Downloads all build artifacts (demo, Storybook, playbook)
- Generates root `index.html` via `scripts/generate-gh-pages-index.mjs`
- Deploys to gh-pages branch with proper permissions

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Script-Based Automation (✅ Major Evolution)

**Location:** `scripts/ops/` and `scripts/checks/`

**Implemented scripts (ops/):**

- `ideas-to-issues.mjs` - Create Issues from idea files
- `create-worktree-pr.mjs` - Create worktree + branch + draft PR
- `generate-pr-content.mjs` - Generate PR body from idea files
- `sync-issue-to-card.mjs` - Sync Issue to Project card
- `merge-subissue-to-parent.mjs` - Merge sub-issue changes
- `archive-idea-for-issue.mjs` - Archive completed ideas
- `manual-update-pr-checkboxes.mjs` - Checkbox management
- `sync-ideas-checklists.mjs` - Checklist sync
- `bump-version.mjs` - Version bumping
- `setup-labels.mjs` - Label configuration

**Implemented scripts (checks/):**

- `pr-requirements.mjs` - Verify PR meets requirements
- `validate-ideas.mjs` - Idea file validation
- `check-ci.mjs` - CI validation
- `lint-guides.mjs` - Guide validation
- `template-coverage.mjs` - Template/guide ratio enforcement

**Root-level scripts:**

- `consolidate-changelog.mjs` - Automated CHANGELOG updates
- `pre-commit-changelog.mjs` - Pre-commit CHANGELOG validation
- `generate-gh-pages-index.mjs` - Root index.html generation
- `record-stories.mjs` - Story recording automation
- `test-storybook.mjs` - Storybook test runner wrapper

**Never Built (workflows replaced by scripts):**

- ❌ `idea_intake.yml` (scripted instead)
- ❌ `pr_sync.yml` (manual via scripts)
- ❌ `status_reconcile.yml` (manual via scripts)

**Impact:** ✅ More flexible than workflow automation, easier to test and debug locally

### Ideas-as-Source-of-Truth Pattern (✅ Unplanned Bonus)

**Structure:**

```
ideas/
  U-*.md                  # Unit component ideas
  C-*.md                  # Composition ideas
  ARCH-*.md               # Architecture ideas
  _archive/2025/          # Completed ideas
```

**Validation:** `.github/workflows/ideas.yml` + `scripts/checks/validate-ideas.mjs`

**Benefits:**

- Single source of truth (no Issue/PR duplication)
- Automatic Issue/PR generation
- Automatic archival on completion
- Version control for requirements
- Template-based consistency

**Status:** ✅ Complete and documented

### Current Conventions (⚠️ Evolved from Plan)

**Labels:**

```
lane:A | lane:B | lane:C | lane:D  (not track:*)
type:unit | type:composition | type:bug  (not type:idea)
```

**Branches:**

```
feat/<ticket-id>  (e.g., feat/U-button-component, feat/C-profile-form)
fix/<ticket-id>   (e.g., fix/ARCH-ci-split)
```

**Ticket IDs:**

```
U-*       # Unit component
C-*       # Composition
ARCH-*    # Architecture
B-*       # Bug (when needed)
```

---

## Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Compliant

1. **Parallel execution** - 5 build jobs run concurrently
2. **Dependency caching** - pnpm and Playwright browsers cached
3. **Artifact isolation** - Each build uploads separate artifacts
4. **Recording isolated** - Only runs on schedule, never blocks merges
5. **Script organization** - Clear separation: ops/, checks/, \_lib/
6. **Ideas-as-source** - Single source of truth implemented
7. **Deploy automation** - Automatic gh-pages deployment on main
8. **Timeout enforcement** - All 7 jobs have timeout controls (implemented 2025-10-28)

### ⚠️ Non-Compliant / Gaps

1. ~~**No timeout enforcement**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED 2025-10-28** - All jobs now have timeouts
   - `check`: 10 minutes
   - `build-storybook`: 10 minutes
   - `storybook-test`: 15 minutes (needs more time for browser tests)
   - `build-demo`: 8 minutes
   - `build-playbook`: 8 minutes
   - `summary`: 5 minutes
   - `record-nightly`: 20 minutes (video processing is slower)

2. **No sticky PR comments** - JUnit/a11y results not posted to PRs
   - **Impact:** Medium (developers must download artifacts)
   - **Status:** Deferred (manual preferred for now)

3. **No automated label mirroring** - Issue labels not synced to PRs
   - **Impact:** Low (manual labeling acceptable)
   - **Status:** Deferred

4. **No artifact size monitoring** - No alerts for bloated builds
   - **Impact:** Low (can cause CI slowdowns over time)
   - **Status:** Identified gap

---

## Missing Components

### High Priority (Should Implement)

1. ~~**Job timeout configuration**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED 2025-10-28**

   All 7 jobs now have appropriate timeouts:
   - `check`: 10 minutes (typecheck, lint, unit tests)
   - `build-storybook`: 10 minutes (static build)
   - `storybook-test`: 15 minutes (browser tests need more time)
   - `build-demo`: 8 minutes (Vite build)
   - `build-playbook`: 8 minutes (VitePress build)
   - `summary`: 5 minutes (aggregate results)
   - `record-nightly`: 20 minutes (video recording + GIF conversion)

2. **Missing scripts:**
   - ~~`scripts/ops/remove-worktree.mjs` - Cleanup after merge~~ ✅ Implemented 2025-10-28 (auto-invoked from `merge-subissue-to-parent.mjs`)
   - `scripts/checks/validate-idea.mjs` - CLI validator (currently workflow-only)

3. **Known Bugs:**
   - ⚠️ `scripts/ops/create-worktree-pr.mjs` - Bug in line 355: passes `args.baseBranch` as `cwd` parameter to `createWorktree()` instead of `root`. This causes git command to fail with ENOENT when base branch is not "main". **Workaround:** Create worktree manually with `git worktree add -b <branch> <path> <base-branch>` and PR with `gh pr create`. **Fix needed:** Change `await createWorktree(worktreePath, branchName, args.baseBranch)` to `await createWorktree(worktreePath, branchName, root)` and modify `createWorktree()` signature to accept base branch parameter properly.

4. **🚨 BREAKING: package.json Path Mismatches** ⚠️ **CRITICAL - Identified 2025-10-28**

   **Impact:** 14 out of 19 pnpm script commands reference incorrect paths after scripts migration

   **Root Cause:** Scripts migrated to `ops/` and `checks/` subdirectories, but package.json not updated

   **Broken Commands:**

   ```bash
   pnpm ci:check          # ❌ scripts/check-ci.mjs → scripts/checks/check-ci.mjs
   pnpm ci:watch          # ❌ scripts/check-ci.mjs → scripts/checks/check-ci.mjs
   pnpm gh:prepare        # ❌ scripts/prepare-gh.mjs → scripts/checks/prepare-gh.mjs
   pnpm gh:setup-labels   # ❌ scripts/setup-labels.mjs → scripts/ops/setup-labels.mjs
   pnpm gh:worktree       # ❌ scripts/create-worktree-pr.mjs → scripts/ops/create-worktree-pr.mjs
   pnpm postcheckout      # ❌ scripts/post-checkout.mjs → scripts/ops/post-checkout.mjs
   pnpm ideas:create      # ❌ scripts/ideas-to-issues.mjs → scripts/ops/ideas-to-issues.mjs
   pnpm ideas:sync        # ❌ scripts/sync-ideas-checklists.mjs → scripts/ops/sync-ideas-checklists.mjs
   pnpm ideas:validate    # ❌ scripts/validate-ideas.mjs → scripts/checks/validate-ideas.mjs
   pnpm new:snippet       # ❌ scripts/new-snippet.mjs → scripts/ops/new-snippet.mjs
   pnpm pr:check          # ❌ scripts/pr-requirements.mjs → scripts/checks/pr-requirements.mjs
   pnpm pr:create-issue   # ❌ scripts/pr-requirements.mjs → scripts/checks/pr-requirements.mjs
   pnpm pr:generate       # ❌ scripts/generate-pr-content.mjs → scripts/ops/generate-pr-content.mjs
   pnpm pr:verify         # ❌ scripts/pr-requirements.mjs → scripts/checks/pr-requirements.mjs
   ```

   **Working Commands:**

   ```bash
   pnpm changelog         # ✅ scripts/ops/consolidate-changelog.mjs
   pnpm gh:setup-project  # ✅ scripts/ops/setup-project.mjs
   pnpm issues:create     # ✅ scripts/ops/create-issues-from-changelog.mjs
   pnpm record:stories    # ✅ scripts/record-stories.mjs (not migrated)
   pnpm storybook:test    # ✅ scripts/test-storybook.mjs (not migrated)
   ```

   **User Impact:**
   - ❌ Most workflow automation commands fail with "ENOENT: no such file"
   - ❌ CI likely broken if using pnpm shortcuts (e.g., `pnpm ideas:validate`)
   - ❌ Documentation and guides reference broken commands

   **Mitigation:** Tracked in Issue #68 (ARCH-scripts-migration-complete) Phase 2

   **Fix:** Sub-issue U-package-json-migration created to systematically update all paths

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Release automation:**
   - `scripts/ops/extract-changelog-section.mjs` - For GitHub Releases
   - `scripts/ops/generate-release-notes.mjs` - Auto-generate release notes

2. **PR automation:**
   - `scripts/ops/sync-pr-labels.mjs` - Auto-label PRs from parent Issues

3. **CI enhancements:**
   - Artifact size validation (warn if >threshold)
   - Conditional job execution based on changed files
   - Build matrix optimization (if monorepo grows)

### Low Priority (Future)

1. **Sticky PR comments** - Parse JUnit/a11y and post to PRs
2. **Recording enhancements** - Auto-discovery of 'record' tagged stories
3. **Self-hosted runners** - Only if GitHub-hosted becomes bottleneck

### Functionality Gaps

- Worktree cleanup automated when running `scripts/ops/merge-subissue-to-parent.mjs`; other merge paths still rely on the CLI
- No standalone idea file validator CLI
- No JUnit parser for PR comment generation
- No automated PR label syncing from parent Issues
- No changelog section extraction for releases
- No artifact size monitoring/alerting

---

## Performance Analysis

### Current State

**✅ Strengths:**

1. **Parallel execution** - 5 build jobs run simultaneously
2. **Effective caching:**
   - pnpm dependencies cached via `actions/setup-node@v6`
   - Playwright browsers cached with versioned keys
   - Cache hit rate: High (browsers ~400MB, saved on every run)
3. **Artifact optimization:**
   - Test results: 30 days retention
   - Build artifacts: 7 days retention (sufficient for deployment)
4. **Isolated recording** - Never blocks regular CI runs

**⚠️ Critical Gap: No Timeout Controls** ✅ **RESOLVED 2025-10-28**

**Finding:** ~~No `timeout-minutes` configured on any job~~ All jobs now have timeouts

**Previous behavior:** Jobs could run up to **6 hours** (GitHub default)

**Implemented solution (2025-10-28):**

- `check`: 10 minutes
- `build-storybook`: 10 minutes
- `storybook-test`: 15 minutes
- `build-demo`: 8 minutes
- `build-playbook`: 8 minutes
- `summary`: 5 minutes
- `record-nightly`: 20 minutes

**Benefits achieved:**

- ✅ Prevents hung processes from consuming runner minutes
- ✅ Fast failure feedback (minutes vs hours)
- ✅ No queue blocking for subsequent workflows
- ✅ Easy to diagnose slow tests vs infinite loops

~~**Documented expectation:** "15-minute job timeouts" (per Guardrails section)~~

~~**Actual implementation:** None~~

~~**Recommendation:** Implement timeout controls immediately (see recommendations above)~~

### Optimization Opportunities

**High Priority:**

1. ✅ **Playwright browser caching** - Already implemented
2. ✅ **Add explicit timeouts** - Implemented 2025-10-28
3. 💡 **Monitor actual job durations** - Collect metrics to tune timeouts (next step)

**Medium Priority:**

1. **Artifact size optimization:**
   - Monitor `storybook-static` size (can grow large with assets)
   - Consider compression for build artifacts
   - Add size checks to CI (warn if artifacts >threshold)

2. **Conditional job execution:**

   ```yaml
   build-playbook:
     if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[playbook]') ||
       contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[docs]')
   ```

3. **Parallelized test execution:**
   - Vitest already uses multiple workers by default
   - Could explicitly configure for CI: `vitest --poolOptions.threads.maxThreads=4`

**Low Priority:**

1. **Self-hosted runners** - Only if GitHub-hosted becomes bottleneck
2. **Build matrix** - Not needed with current 6 jobs
3. **Turbo/Nx caching** - Consider if monorepo patterns emerge

### Long-Term (Future)

1. **Sticky PR comments** (if team requests)
2. **Self-hosted runners** (if cost becomes concern)
3. **Advanced caching strategies** (if build times grow)

---

## Guardrails & Invariants

### Guardrails

**1. Limit Bloat in CI/CD Pipelines**

- **Rule:** Each job has a **single responsibility** and **must not exceed 15 minutes**
- **Why:** Large jobs become hard to debug, slow, and unmanageable
- **Action:** Split responsibilities into discrete jobs, set timeouts
- **Status:** ✅ Jobs are split well, timeout enforcement implemented 2025-10-28

**2. Manual Steps and Automation Boundaries**

- **Rule:** Manual workflows (deploys, recording) must **never block** main CI
- **Why:** Blocking manual tasks leads to slow feedback and bottlenecks
- **Action:** Isolate optional steps (recording) to separate job with conditions
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented (recording only runs on schedule)

**3. No Wasted CI/CD Time**

- **Rule:** CI jobs should be **fast** and use **caching** wherever possible
- **Why:** Slow CI reduces team productivity and delays feedback
- **Action:** Use pnpm caching, Playwright browser caching, parallel execution
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented (excellent caching strategy)

**4. Artifact Lifecycle Management**

- **Rule:** Test results retained longer (30d), builds shorter (7d)
- **Why:** Tests are historical data, builds are deployment artifacts
- **Action:** Configure retention-days appropriately
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented

**5. Seams for Configuration**

- **Rule:** Single place to configure test reporters, artifact names, timeouts
- **Why:** Consistency and easy updates
- **Action:** CI workflow is single source of truth
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented

### Invariants

**1. No Wasted CI/CD Time**

- **Invariant:** CI jobs must complete within **set time limits** (15 minutes target)
- **Why:** Slow CI/CD jobs reduce team productivity and delay feedback
- **Action:** Set timeouts, split tasks, use caching
- **Status:** ✅ **COMPLIANT** - Timeouts configured 2025-10-28 (all jobs ≤20min)

**2. Parallel Execution Pattern**

- **Invariant:** Build jobs that don't depend on each other run in **parallel**
- **Why:** Minimize total CI duration
- **Action:** Only `storybook-test` depends on `build-storybook`, rest run in parallel
- **Status:** ✅ Compliant

**3. Recording Never Blocks**

- **Invariant:** Recording job **never runs on PR/push**, only schedule/manual
- **Why:** Recording is slow and can be flaky, should never block development
- **Action:** Conditional job with `if: github.event_name == 'schedule' || ...`
- **Status:** ✅ Compliant

**4. Deploy Follows CI**

- **Invariant:** Deploy workflow only triggers **after CI completes successfully**
- **Why:** Never deploy broken code
- **Action:** `workflow_run` trigger with `completed` status filter
- **Status:** ✅ Compliant (assumed, not verified in this document)

**5. Artifact Names Are Unique**

- **Invariant:** Artifact names must not collide across runs
- **Why:** Prevent download confusion and overwrite issues
- **Action:** Use descriptive names, potentially add SHA suffix
- **Status:** ✅ Compliant (static names work with GitHub's run isolation)

**6. Cache Keys Are Versioned**

- **Invariant:** Playwright cache keys include **version** to prevent corruption
- **Why:** Breaking changes in Playwright require fresh browser downloads
- **Action:** Include Playwright version in cache key
- **Status:** ✅ Compliant

---

## Risk Controls

### Implemented

1. ✅ **Prevent ping pong** - Check `if: github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]'` on sync jobs
2. ✅ **Avoid artifact collisions** - Use descriptive, unique artifact names
3. ✅ **Skip fork actions** - All write actions skip on forks (not verified)
4. ✅ **Keep recording isolated** - Use schedule/manual trigger only
5. ✅ **Continue on error** - Recording uses `continue-on-error: true`
6. ✅ **Concurrency controls** - Cancel in-progress runs on new push

### Missing

1. ~~⚠️ **Timeout controls**~~ ✅ **IMPLEMENTED 2025-10-28** - All jobs protected
2. ⚠️ **Artifact size limits** - No monitoring for bloated builds
3. ⚠️ **Job failure notifications** - Relies on GitHub's default email

---

## Evolution Notes

### What Changed from Original Plan

**✅ Better than planned:**

1. **Ideas-as-source-of-truth** - Eliminates Issue/PR duplication
2. **Script-based approach** - More flexible than workflow automation
3. **Playwright browser caching** - Not in original plan, major time saver
4. **Playbook build track** - Added full VitePress documentation pipeline
5. **Sub-issue pipeline** - Full merge/sync capabilities beyond basic tasklist

**⚠️ Different approach:**

1. **Issue→PR automation** - Script-based instead of workflow-based
2. **Label taxonomy** - `lane:*` instead of `track:*` (simpler)
3. **Branch naming** - `feat/<ticket-id>` instead of `feat/issue-#-slug` (cleaner)
4. **Status reconciliation** - Manual via scripts instead of automatic (better control)

**❌ Deferred indefinitely:**

1. **Sticky PR comments** - JUnit/a11y results not posted to PRs
2. **Automated label mirroring** - Manual labeling preferred
3. **Automated status reconciliation** - Manual control preferred
4. **Idempotency tokens** - Not needed with simpler duplicate prevention

### Craft Principles Applied

- **Seams** - Clear boundaries between CI jobs, script categories (ops/checks/\_lib)
- **Invariants** - Recording never blocks, parallel execution, cache versioning
- **Rollout** - Incremental: CI → recording → deploy → optimization
