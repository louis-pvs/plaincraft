# CI/CD Implementation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Owner:** Pair C (DevOps)  
**Status:** ✅ 85% complete  
**Goal:** Fast, parallelised CI pipeline with automated deployment and recording

---

## Snapshot

- CI runs in six parallel jobs with nightly recording isolated; all jobs have explicit timeouts (10–20 min)
- Deploy workflow consumes CI artifacts and publishes Storybook, demo, and playbook to `gh-pages`
- Script-first operating model (ideas-as-source-of-truth, worktree helpers) replaced the original workflow-automation plan
- Major bonus work delivered: changelog automation, playbook build, Playwright cache management, sub-issue pipeline
- Legacy single-file script shims now warn and exit; package.json shortcuts already point to the ops/checks structure

## Delivered Capabilities

- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): six concurrent jobs with caching, concurrency controls, artifact retention, JUnit uploads, and guarded nightly recording
- Deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): consumes build artifacts, generates landing index, deploys to `gh-pages`
- Script suite: ideas-to-issues, worktree/PR helpers, checklist sync, changelog automation, manual guardrails in `scripts/ops` and `scripts/checks`
- Guardrail artefacts: `scripts/GUARDRAILS.md`, docs for template enforcement and ideas validation
- Playwright and pnpm caching: versioned restore/save pattern prevents cold starts and keeps total runtime within guardrails

---

## Outstanding Gaps & Risks

**Critical**

- None (all high-severity blockers addressed)

**Important**

- `scripts/ops/create-worktree-pr.mjs` passes `args.baseBranch` as the `cwd` parameter (line 355), breaking worktree creation when the base branch ≠ `main`
- Developers still rely on workflow-only validation of idea files; consider promoting `pnpm ideas:validate` in docs so the CLI path gets habitual use
- Artifact growth is unmonitored; large bundles could silently slow down CI
- Failure notifications rely on GitHub email defaults; no targeted alerting for broken jobs

**Watchlist**

- Release automation scripts (changelog extract, release notes) remain backlog items
- Recording enhancements (story auto-discovery, size enforcement) deferred
- Conditional job execution and advanced caching earmarked for future scale needs

---

## Performance & Observability

- Timeouts now cap every job, preventing six-hour fallbacks and keeping queue utilisation predictable
- pnpm dependencies and Playwright browsers are cached with version tags, yielding consistently high hit rates
- Test artifacts persist for 30 days; build artifacts for 7 days to balance debuggability with storage cost
- Parallelisation keeps total CI runtime inside the 15-minute goal, with only `storybook-test` depending on `build-storybook`
- Next optimisation step: gather timing data across 5–10 runs to tune timeouts and flag drift

---

## Next Focus

- Monitor job durations and adjust timeouts or splits if sustained drift appears
- Add artifact size monitoring to catch bloated Storybook/demo outputs
- Surface `pnpm ideas:validate` in developer guides so the CLI stays visible alongside the workflow automation
- Evaluate conditional builds (e.g., skip playbook when only component code changes) once artifact trends are known

---

## Guardrails & Invariants

- Jobs stay under 15 minutes and have explicit `timeout-minutes` declarations
- Non-critical automation (recording, deploy) never blocks main CI lanes
- Parallel execution is the default; only true dependencies (`storybook-test`) serialize
- Deployments trigger only after successful CI completion via `workflow_run`
- Artifact names remain unique per run to avoid collisions; caches include version keys to prevent stale browsers

---

## Evolution Summary

- Shifted from workflow-based automation to script-first control for ideas, PR preparation, and checklist hygiene
- Simplified taxonomy (`lane/*` labels, `feat/<ticket-id>` branches) increased clarity without losing traceability
- Added changelog automation, playbook build pipeline, and sub-issue merge helpers beyond the original scope
- Deferred sticky PR comments, automated label mirroring, automated status reconciliation, and idempotency tokens indefinitely
