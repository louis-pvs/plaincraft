Status: Draft (will finalize after Week 4 checkpoint)

## 1. Overview

- Phase Start: 2025-11-03
- Target Checkpoint: 2025-12-03
- Objective: Establish consistent structural hygiene for issues and PRs prior to automation.
- ADR Reference: /docs/adr/2025-11-03-ci-pr-issue-workflow.md
- Runbook Reference: /docs/runbooks/adoption-ci-pr-issue-workflow-phase-1.md

## 2. Metrics Trend (Snapshot Placeholder)

| Week | Issue Link Usage | Struct Completeness | Template Usage | Priority Declaration | Reviewer Friction | Notes                      |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0    | N/A              | N/A                 | N/A            | N/A                  | N/A               | Baseline pre-sampling      |

| 4    | TBD              | TBD                 | TBD            | TBD                  | TBD               | Checkpoint week            |

## 3. Interventions Log

| Date          | Intervention                    | Trigger            | Owner  | Impact (Qualitative) |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| (placeholder) | Added README Phase 1 snippet    | Kickoff clarity    | Lane D | Improved visibility  |
| (placeholder) | Shared example issue structures | Link usage warning | Lane D | Pending              |

## 4. Risk & Mitigation Outcomes

Summarize which risks materialized (refer to runbook risk register) and effectiveness of mitigations.

## 5. Recommendations for Phase 2

(To be completed after Weeks 2-3 data):

- Minimum automation scope (e.g., link presence check PR guardrail)
- Deferred checks (structural completeness heuristic)
- Tooling needs (parser helper feasibility from Lane A)

## 6. Exit Criteria Validation

- Consecutive weeks meeting all targets? (Y/N)
- Average ≥95% of targets across period? (Y/N)
- Reviewer friction trend declining? (Y/N)

## 7. Appendix
