# Archived: Scripts Architecture Diagram

This document moved to the archive on 2025-10-28 during the scripts-docs consolidation.  
The active source of truth now lives in:

- `guides/guide-scripts.md` — guardrails and CLI contract.
- `docs/scripts-reference.md` — lightweight index pointing back to the guide and templates.

Refer to the repository history if you need the original architecture diagram.
