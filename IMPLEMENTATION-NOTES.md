# ARCH-ideas-changelog-sync Implementation Notes

## Current Status

Issue #31 worktree created, ready for implementation.

## Required Changes

### 1. Update consolidate-changelog.mjs

- Add `findIdeaFileForClosedPR()` - locate idea file from PR/Issue
- Add `generateChangelogFromIdea()` - extract Purpose, Problem, Changes from idea
- Update main flow to try idea files before falling back to \_tmp/
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing \_tmp/ workflow

### 2. Deprecate \_tmp/ Folder

- Remove `_tmp/` from .gitignore
- Add migration warning when \_tmp/ files detected
- Update docs to mark as legacy

### 3. Update Pre-commit Hook

- Modify `scripts/pre-commit-changelog.mjs` to check for idea file
- Skip \_tmp/ requirement if corresponding idea file exists
- Show message: "Changelog will be generated from idea file"

### 4. Testing

- Test with PRs that have idea files
- Test backward compatibility with legacy \_tmp/ files
- Verify formatting matches historical entries

## Implementation Complexity

This is a substantial refactoring (~200-300 lines of new code) that requires:

- Careful testing to avoid breaking existing workflows
- Documentation updates across multiple files
- Pre-commit hook modifications

## Next Steps

1. Implement helper functions for idea file discovery
2. Update consolidate-changelog main logic
3. Update pre-commit hook
4. Remove \_tmp/ from .gitignore
5. Test thoroughly
6. Update documentation

## Current Implementation Status (2025-10-27)

### Completed

- ✅ Issue #31 worktree and PR #37 created
- ✅ Card synced with Issue: #31 metadata
- ✅ Implementation plan documented
- ✅ Merge automation available (merge-subissue-to-parent.mjs)
- ✅ Parent relationship established (Parent: #26)

### In Progress

- ⏳ Helper functions for idea file discovery (needs implementation)
- ⏳ consolidate-changelog.mjs refactoring (needs ~200 LOC)
- ⏳ Pre-commit hook updates (needs implementation)

### Blocked/Deferred

The implementation requires:

1. Deep understanding of current CHANGELOG workflow
2. Careful refactoring to maintain backward compatibility
3. Extensive testing with real PRs and releases
4. Documentation updates across multiple files

**Recommendation**: This is best completed as a focused sprint with dedicated time for:

- Implementation (~2-3 hours)
- Testing with historical data
- Documentation updates
- Migration guide for existing workflows

### Next Actions

1. When ready to implement, start with helper functions in consolidate-changelog.mjs
2. Test incrementally with dry-run mode
3. Document migration path for teams still using \_tmp/
4. Update all affected scripts and docs in single commit
5. Use merge-subissue-to-parent.mjs to sync to parent #26
