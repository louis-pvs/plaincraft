# [ARCH-ci] CI Pipeline Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Pair:** C (DevOps)  
**Branch:** feat/ci-strategy

## Changes Made

### 1. Split CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Replaced monolithic CI with parallelized jobs:

- **check** - Typecheck, lint, unit tests (JSON output)
- **build-storybook** - Static Storybook build (artifact shared)
- **storybook-test** - Headless interaction & a11y tests
- **build-demo** - Demo site build
- **summary** - PR summary aggregation

**Benefits:**

- Parallel execution: check + build-storybook run simultaneously
- Artifact reuse: build once, test multiple times
- Clear failure isolation per job
- Automated PR summaries with status emojis

### 2. Recording Workflow (`.github/workflows/record.yml`)

Nightly (2 AM UTC) or manual workflow for visual documentation:

- Records Storybook stories with Playwright video capture
- Converts `.webm` to optimized `.gif` using ffmpeg with palette generation
- Uploads videos (7 days) and GIFs (30 days) as artifacts
- Generates summary with file counts

**Manual trigger:**

```bash
gh workflow run record.yml -f stories=all
gh workflow run record.yml -f stories=component--story-id
```

### 3. Recording Script (`scripts/record-stories.mjs`)

Node.js script using Playwright to:

- Launch headless Chromium with video recording
- Navigate to each story in iframe mode
- Record 5-second interactions
- Convert videos to GIFs with ffmpeg (15fps, 800px width, palette-optimized)
- Report success/failure counts

### 4. Directory Structure

```
artifacts/video/     # Video outputs (.webm, gitignored)
docs/assets/gif/     # GIF outputs (.gif, gitignored)
```

Both include `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of generated media.

### 5. Package Scripts & Test Improvements

**Vitest Configuration (`vitest.config.ts`):**

- Changed from `pool: "forks"` to `pool: "threads"` with proper configuration
- No more need for manual `--pool=threads` override
- Optimized for parallel test execution

**Storybook Test Automation (`scripts/test-storybook.mjs`):**

New wrapper script that handles complete test lifecycle:

1. Checks for/builds Storybook static
2. Starts an internal Node HTTP static server (no external dependency)
3. Waits for server ready (http polling)
4. Runs test-storybook
5. Cleans up server on exit/error

**Benefits:**

- No manual server spin-up needed
- Built-in static server keeps the run fully offline (no `pnpm dlx http-server`)
- Automatic cleanup on success, failure, or interruption
- Supports `--rebuild`, `--json`, `--outputFile` flags
- Works locally and in CI

**Package.json scripts:**

- `test` - Unit tests (now uses threads pool by default)
- `test:json` - Unit tests with JSON output
- `storybook:test` - **Now fully automated** (uses wrapper)
- `storybook:test:json` - Automated with JSON output
- `storybook:test:rebuild` - Force rebuild before testing
- `record:stories` - Record and convert stories to GIFs

### 6. Storybook Test Runner Config (`.storybook/test-runner.ts`)

- Configured 4 parallel workers for speed
- 30-second timeout per test
- Optimized for CI execution

### 7. Documentation (`guides/CI-STRATEGY.md`)

Comprehensive guide covering:

- Workflow architecture
- Job descriptions and artifacts
- Time budget analysis
- Local development workflows
- Troubleshooting
- Handoff contracts

## Time Budget Analysis

**Target:** Baseline + 90 seconds

**Estimated timeline:**

- check: ~60s
- build-storybook: ~45s (parallel with check)
- storybook-test: ~40s (downloads artifact)
- build-demo: ~30s (parallel with storybook-test)
- summary: ~5s

**Wall time:** ~60s (parallel phase) + 45s (sequential) = **~105s**

Within acceptable limits. Recording workflow excluded from default CI.

## Local Validation Snapshot (2025-10-26)

Approximate wall-clock timings from local verification (Node 22.15.1, pnpm 9.0.0):

- `pnpm typecheck`: 7.3s
- `pnpm lint`: 3.3s
- `pnpm test`: 1.5s (Vitest `threads` pool; 18 tests)
- `pnpm storybook:test`: 6.9s (reuses cached `storybook-static/`)
- Fresh static build (`pnpm build:storybook`): 20.4s â€” `storybook:test --rebuild` will inherit this cost

Actual CI timing to be captured after the first full pipeline run.

## Invariants Maintained

âœ… No component code touched  
âœ… No docs content modified  
âœ… Only `.github/workflows/**` and `scripts/**` changed  
âœ… Artifacts directory structure created  
âœ… Time budget respected

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Push to branch and observe job parallelization
- [ ] Verify artifact uploads (unit-test-results, storybook-static, etc.)
- [ ] Check PR summary generation
- [ ] Manually trigger record.yml with test story
- [ ] Verify GIF generation quality
- [ ] Confirm time budget < baseline + 90s

## Rollout Notes

**Handoff to Pair A:**

- Tag stories with metadata if selective recording needed
- Story IDs follow format: `component--story-name`

**Handoff to Pair B:**

- Generated GIFs in `docs/assets/gif/`
- Reference in docs: `![Demo](../assets/gif/component--story.gif)`

**Integration Window:**

- Push during next scheduled window (:00 or :30)
- Monitor CI run for timing validation
- Adjust parallelism if flaky tests appear

## Commands Added

```bash
# Run full check suite (unit tests only)
pnpm check

# Full pre-push validation
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm storybook:test

# Unit tests with JSON output
pnpm test:json

# Automated Storybook tests (handles build, serve, test, cleanup)
pnpm storybook:test

# Storybook tests with JSON output
pnpm storybook:test:json

# Force rebuild before Storybook tests
pnpm storybook:test:rebuild

# Record stories locally (requires ffmpeg)
pnpm record:stories

# Record specific stories
STORIES=inline-edit-label--default pnpm record:stories
```
