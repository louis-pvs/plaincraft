# Developer Guides Deprecated

This folder is now an archive checkpoint. Developer workflows live alongside
their source templates:

- `/templates/<name>/README.md` - entry point for scaffolding and executable
  steps (template-first is the rule).
- `snippets|flows|scripts/**/README.md` - thin hand-off back to the owning
  template's `USAGE.md` and Storybook docs.
- `storybook/docs/**` and `playbook/pages/**` - long-form narratives and
  examples owned by Lane B.

Legacy guides (pre-template-first) live under `_archive/2025/11-guides-sunset/`.
Do not add new content here - link the owning template README instead.

If you land on anything inside `guides/_archive/` or `guides/DEPRECATED/`, treat it as historical reference only. Do not follow, copy, or update those files for live workflowsâ€”always bounce back to the template README, Storybook doc, or Playbook pattern that owns the narrative today.
