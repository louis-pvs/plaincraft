# Backlog Pilot Scripts-First Ops

- **Audience:** Lane D backlog pilots stewarding the Plaincraft Roadmap
- **Decision Anchor:** [ARCH-scripts-first-project-governance](https://github.com/louis-pvs/plaincraft/blob/main/ideas/ARCH-scripts-first-project-governance.md)
- **Owner:** @lane.d
- **TTL:** Review by 2026-04-30
- **Future Metric:** Weekly governance report delivered with ≤48 hour lag and zero duplicate project IDs
- **Recorded Media:** Record later

## Why it Matters

Scripts-First only works when the backlog keeps Projects as the status source of truth. Lane D pilots watch for drift, unblock automation failures, and make sure Roadmap metadata mirrors idea files and branches. With a published playbook and a scheduled audit report, backlog pilots can resolve issues before they snowball into stale cards or missing owners.

## Daily Intake Review

1. Run `pnpm scripts:lifecycle-smoke --yes --output json` on the current branch (or download the latest artifact from the **Project & Issue Management → Sync Project Fields** workflow). For nightly verification, point the job at a sandbox clone: `pnpm scripts:lifecycle-smoke --execute --sandbox ../plaincraft-sandbox --output json`.
2. Confirm new tickets include `Lane`, `Priority`, and checklist metadata before approving automation bootstrap.
3. If `pnpm guardrails` fails because of missing owner/scaffold refs, bounce back to the lane owner with the `lifecycle-smoke-report.json` excerpt.
4. Add `blocked by` notes in the roadmap when automation fails so other lanes can see the hold.

## Weekly Audit Flow (cron Mondays 09:00 UTC)

1. Review the artifact from the **Project Governance Audit** workflow (GitHub → Actions → `project-governance-report`).
2. Cross-check the `statuses` list against `.repo/projects.json`. Missing statuses or lanes require a `pnpm gh:setup-project` run with updated templates.
3. Spot-check random items directly in the Roadmap for owner and priority alignment.
4. Update the audit log (see ADR below) with discrepancies and remediation actions. Include the latest `ops:report -- --yes` artifact so downstream lanes can reconcile schema changes quickly.

## Rollback & Escalation

- **Automation failure (scripts crash):** capture the run ID, set Project status to `Pending-<script>`, and page Lane C with the guardrails output. Include the dry-run transcript plus the status note template below when re-running with `--yes`.
- **Schema drift (missing field / option):** re-run `pnpm gh:setup-project --yes` to reconcile fields, then rerun `pnpm ops:report --yes` to refresh the cache.
- **Duplicate IDs:** immediately archive the least active card using `pnpm ops:closeout --id <ID> --dry-run` to confirm impact, then delete manually if safe.
- **Escalation path:** Lane D → Lane C (script owners) → Lane A (API/pipeline) if GitHub permissions block action.

## Status Note Template

Paste the following status note on the Project card whenever you move it with automation:

```
Automation: `{command}` (`--dry-run` attached)
Project: `{from}` → `{to}`
Idea: `{ideaPath}` (status now `{ideaStatus}`)
PR: {prUrl}
Next action: {nextStep or "None"}
```

Replace `{command}` with the executed script (`pnpm ops:open-or-update-pr -- --id ARCH-123 --yes`, etc.) and attach the JSON transcript generated in dry-run. This keeps the backlog audit trail aligned with idea frontmatter and ensures future rotations can retrace the runbook.
