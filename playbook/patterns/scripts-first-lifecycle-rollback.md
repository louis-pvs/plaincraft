# Scripts-First Lifecycle Rollback

- **Audience:** Lane C implementers and Lane D release captains responding to failed rollouts
- **Decision Anchor:** [ARCH-scripts-first-project-governance](https://github.com/louis-pvs/plaincraft/blob/main/ideas/ARCH-scripts-first-project-governance.md)
- **Owner:** @lane.b
- **TTL:** Review by 2026-06-30
- **Future Metric:** < 1 hour from rollback trigger to restored Ticketed status with attached transcripts
- **Recorded Media:** Record later

## Why it Matters

Rollback procedures must walk the lifecycle backward without losing audit trails. When a branch needs to be abandoned or a PR reverted, automation should unwind each state change so Projects, Playbook notes, and changelog entries stay coherent.

## Worked Example

`pnpm pr:verify` flags an unmet acceptance item after review. To rollback:

1. `node scripts/ops/remove-worktree.mjs 91 --yes --keep-remote` cleans the bootstrap worktree while leaving the remote branch for inspection.
2. `pnpm gh:worktree 91 --dry-run` confirms the idea frontmatter still reflects `Status: in-progress`. If it drifted, rerun with `--yes` to reapply the scripted metadata.
3. `pnpm pr:generate --yes` rewrites the draft PR body so unchecked tasks surface again and reviewers see the reset context.
4. Post in the ADR thread with the dry-run transcripts and attach the Playbook rollback note so stakeholders know the current state.

The GitHub Project item falls back to `Branched` or `Ticketed` automatically based on the script output, keeping the reporting board honest.

## Constraints to Honour

- Run `remove-worktree.mjs` before editing the idea file. Manual edits risk diverging from the status SoT.
- Always capture new dry-run logs in the status note; rollback without evidence is treated as manual intervention.
- Use the same commands that moved the lifecycle forward to reverse itâ€”never edit the Project card directly.
- If release notes already shipped, append a new `_tmp/` entry that references the rollback and rerun `pnpm changelog` so the history records the change.
