# Plaincraft Playbook

Welcome to the Plaincraft Playbook — a living collection of component patterns, architecture decisions, and best practices for building accessible, maintainable UI components.

## What is Plaincraft?

Plaincraft is a library of self-contained, accessible React UI components ("snippets") that follow SOLID principles and headless architecture patterns. Each component is designed to be:

- **Accessible** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with proper ARIA, keyboard navigation, and focus management
- **Headless** — Business logic separated from presentation for maximum flexibility
- **Type-safe** — Full TypeScript support with strict types
- **Tested** — Unit tests, interaction tests, and accessibility tests included
- **Well-documented** — Comprehensive API docs, adoption guides, and Storybook examples

## Quick Links

- [Component Patterns](/patterns/) — Explore reusable component patterns
- [Architecture Guide](/architecture) — Understand the headless architecture
- [Storybook](https://louis-pvs.github.io/plaincraft/storybook/) — Interactive component demos
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/louis-pvs/plaincraft) — Source code and contributions

## Getting Started

Browse the [Patterns](/patterns/) section to explore individual components, or read the [Architecture Guide](/architecture) to understand the design principles behind Plaincraft.

Each pattern page includes:

- **Why it exists** — The problem this component solves
- **API documentation** — Props, types, and usage examples
- **Architecture overview** — Controller hook, view components, and composition patterns
- **Adoption guide** — Step-by-step integration instructions
- **Accessibility notes** — ARIA patterns, keyboard interactions, and screen reader support
