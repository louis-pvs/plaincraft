# Plaincraft Playbook

Welcome to the Plaincraft Playbook — a living collection of component patterns, architecture decisions, and best practices for building accessible, maintainable UI components.

## What is Plaincraft?

Plaincraft is a library of self-contained, accessible React UI components ("snippets") that follow SOLID principles and headless architecture patterns. Each component is designed to be:

- **Accessible** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with proper ARIA, keyboard navigation, and focus management
- **Headless** — Business logic separated from presentation for maximum flexibility
- **Type-safe** — Full TypeScript support with strict types
- **Tested** — Unit tests, interaction tests, and accessibility tests included
- **Well-documented** — Comprehensive API docs, adoption guides, and Storybook examples
